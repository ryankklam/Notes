## Iteration planning
Best approaches
 - Review and reprioritize the team backlog ahead of iteration planning 
 - Clearly communicate Story details and priorities to ensure understanding and alignment
 - Maintain neutrality as to not influence the team to over commit
 - Prior to Iteration Planning, prepare some preliminary Iteration Goals based on the team¡¯s progress in the PI so far
 - Apply capacity allocation to the team backlog to make prioritizing unlike work easier


Common anti-patterns
 - Delving too deep into technical discussions
 - Prioritized Stories don¡¯t align to the business objectives or the team¡¯s PI Objectives
 - Bringing Stories that haven¡¯t been refined and prioritized
 - Product Owner directs the team on how the work should be done
 - The team under commits due to fear of failure
 - No time is reserved for support activities

Iteration goals provide the following benefits: They align the team members and the Product Owner to the mission. They align the people to the Program Increment (PI) Objectives. They provide context for understanding and addressing cross-team dependencies.
